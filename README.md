mailchimp-bulk-user-delete
==========================

A quick and dirty tool to bulk delete some mailchimp members.

This is formed from many iterations making my own tools. I thought I'd post this online for people to use here:
http://www.palpa.co.uk/geeky/mailchimp-bulk-user-delete

One person came back saying that they were not sure if they could trust what the programme actually did, and could I not just post the code for them to use.
So here is that code.

I'm afraid it's very poorly commented.

It's based on Mailchimps basic API calls, and just takes an uploaded form or emails and deletes them!
